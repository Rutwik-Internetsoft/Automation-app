{
    "__init__": "This is the constructor method for initializing the test class. It accepts an Appium driver instance as a parameter and sets it as the driver for the test automation. The constructor also initializes various wait times (`short_wait`, `wait`, `long_wait`) for different levels of waiting during interactions with the application. It creates an instance of the `Calculations` class for performing calculations during the test. The method then initializes the `Locators` class and loads various locators needed for calculations, common actions, and cash log operations by calling specific locator functions. Additionally, it initializes cash-related variables (`Cash_Drawer_AMT`, `Cash_out_AMT`, `Cash_in_AMT`) to track the cash amounts during the test scenario. These setup operations ensure that the class is ready to perform actions and calculations on the app when the test begins.",
    
    "check_cash_log_amt": "This function verifies the cash amounts in the cash log. It navigates to the cash log screen, retrieves the cash drawer, cash out, and cash in amounts, and then checks if the sum of the cash drawer and cash out amounts equals the cash in amount. If they match, the function returns True, indicating the cash log is balanced. Otherwise, it returns False. The function also handles navigating back to the home screen after verification. If an error occurs during any of these steps, it returns an error message with the exception details.",
    
    "ordering": "This function handles the process of placing an order, processing the payment, and performing cash log checks during the transaction. It begins by checking the current cash drawer and cash out amounts. The function adds multiple items to the order and proceeds with payment calculation. It prints the current cash drawer and cash out amounts, then simulates a customer payment using a randomly selected cash button. After the payment, the function updates the cash drawer amount based on the amount paid by the customer. If applicable, it checks and deducts change given to the customer. The function also handles refunds and tips if the test parameter specifies 'refund' or 'tip', respectively. After the transaction, the function performs a cash log check to ensure the drawer and cash out amounts are accurate. If the cash log is balanced (with a margin of error), it returns True; otherwise, it returns a message indicating discrepancies in the cash log. In case of errors during any of these steps, the function returns the error message."
